title: Blog based  Jekyll on github
---



Today I found a very amazing project on github (util now rise up to more than 1K stars). And  I had a try and setup my own based on  that project [barryclark/jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)

So just modify some basic settings ,  now make  it here and everything go well.
